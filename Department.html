  ✨ Our church family is blessed with many departments — the Choir lifts our hearts in worship, 
  the Ushers welcome with love, and the Drama unit brings God’s word alive. The Prayer team stands 
  in the gap, Evangelism shares Christ with the world, Bible Study helps us grow deeper, and the 
  Follow-up team ensures no one is left behind. The Media department captures every moment so the 
  message reaches far and wide, and all other great departments. Together, every department works hand in hand to glorify God — and 
  there’s always a place for you too. 💕
